# Convex Optimization via Semidefinite Relaxations (SDR)

## About
This repository contains a compact project on applying **Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR)** to classic non-convex problems:
- **MIMO detection** (communications)
- **Max-Cut** (combinatorial optimization)
- **Graph coloring** (chromatic number bounds and algorithms)

It includes a self-contained **project report** and two executable notebooks. The report presents the derivations and algorithms; the notebooks reproduce core experiments and visualizations.
