# Convex-Optimization-SDR
Convex optimization project exploring semidefinite relaxations (SDR) for three problems—MIMO detection, Max-Cut, and Graph Coloring—including SDP formulations, Goemans–Williamson hyperplane rounding, Lovász theta bounds, and a refined Karger–Motwani–Sudan coloring approach.
